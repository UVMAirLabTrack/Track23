To allow the ESP32's to communicate with the Pi, or another PC run the following commands. Otherwise the Serial Port won't appear

sudo systemctl stop brltty-udev.service
sudo systemctl mask brltty-udev.service
sudo systemctl stop brltty.service
sudo systemctl disable brltty.service

for the system to work with nomachine without needing a connection to a monitor
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user
to go back to standard
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
to boot the gui on a monitor
sudo systemctl start gdm3

note: by defualt access to the ttyusb is denied.
To rectify this

sudo usermod -a -G tty yourname
sudo usermod -a -G dialout yourname
where yourname is dev
.
