Current list of packages and nodes
launch files 
world_gen 
    world_viewer_launch_full  Loads up Rviz, with a map publisher, and marker nodes, with an odom_map transform node
    world_viewer_launch  Loads up Rviz, with a map publisher, and marker nodes
    world_circle_launch, starts up the 4 way light control publisher, and the circle odometry publisher
    track_launch currently only boots up the 4_way_state publisher. will add more in time.


four_way_light
    pub  This is a publisher node to publish to four_way_state
direct_io
    esp_serial  This is the converter from state to serial coms for the ESP32

        These need updated to work with the 4 int control instead of 2int
    testpub sends out an 8 integer message to test 4 possible nodes
    direct_light sends along the four_way_state topic defunct since updated
    direct_servo sends along the train_state topic
    direct_master sends along any list of states, better for sending individual commands to all nodes
    

world_gen
    gen generates a vizualiztion file for RVIZ
    four_way_markers  creates the markers for the map
    parse_and_pass  working on a new pose method, incomplete

testing_pubs  
    linear_x_odometry  generates an odom topic of a car driing along he X Axis
    circle_odometery  generates a car driing in a circle_odometery
    color_publisher  former design for four_way_state, currently defunct.

do this on the pi soon
