Notes. If your ESP32 board has the GPIO6, GPIO7, GPIO8, GPIO9, GPIO10, and GPIO11 pins, you must not use them because they are connected to the flash memory of the ESP32: if you use them, the ESP32 will not work.

The GPIO1 (TX0) and GPIO3 (RX0) pins are used to communicate with the computer in UART via USB. If you use them, you will not be able to upload programs to the board or use the serial monitor via the USB port. They can be useful for programming the board without a USB but with an external programmer instead. Fortunately, there are other UART interfaces available.

Pins GPIO36 (VP), GPIO39 (VN), GPIO34, and GPIO35 can only be used as input. They also do not have internal pull-up and pull-down resistors (pinMode(36, INPUT_PULLUP) or pinMode(36, INPUT_PULLDOWN) cannot be used).

Some pins have a unique function when starting the ESP32. These are called ESP32 Strapping Pins .

They are used to put the ESP32 in BOOT mode (to run the program written in the flash memory) or in FLASH mode (to upload the program to the flash memory). Depending on the voltage available on these pins, the ESP32 will start either in BOOT mode or in FLASH mode.

The strapping pins are the GPIO0, GPIO2, GPIO12 (MTDI) and GPIO15 (MTDO) . You can use them, but you must be careful when setting a logic state (3.3V or 0V) with an external pull-up or pull-down resistor.
