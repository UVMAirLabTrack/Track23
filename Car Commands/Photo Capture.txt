To capture images from the car.
Open a terminal window and paste in this command:

python webcam_capture.py

this will then ask you to set the resolution.
the options are:   to not change the res  use any other key  (it seems to default to 640X480)
480X320  L
640x480  M
1280X720 H
1920X1080 X

you can also edit these values  more on this later.  the L and M options seem to crop width off. 

Next enter the folder name for where the photos will be, i reccomend new folders for each type of sign.

lastly it will ask what you want to call the files themselves  "stop"   it will create stop_1 --- stop_n

a window with video will pop up. to capture frames, have this window selected. then hit the spacebar.  the terminal will tell you you've captured a photo.
To exit. hit the "q" key with the video window selected.

to find the photos, simply open "files" (second icon from the top on the left pane <<< below firefox)  and look for your folder, it will be in this window, not buried in another folder, promise.
if you want to edit the possible resolutions, simply open the "webcam_capture.py" file from "files" (located in "home")  and change one of the res blocks at the top of the file structured like  "highres = [1280x720]"
