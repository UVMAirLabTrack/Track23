To allow the ESP32's to communicate with the Pi, or another PC run the following commands. Otherwise the Serial Port won't appear

sudo systemctl stop brltty-udev.service
sudo systemctl mask brltty-udev.service
sudo systemctl stop brltty.service
sudo systemctl disable brltty.service

for the system to work with nomachine without needing a connection to a monitor
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user
to go back to standard
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
to boot the gui on a monitor
sudo systemctl start gdm3

note: by default access to the ttyusb is denied.
To rectify this

sudo usermod -a -G tty yourname
sudo usermod -a -G dialout yourname

sudo usermod -a -G tty ian
sudo usermod -a -G dialout ian 

where yourname is dev

sudo nano ~/.bashrc
paste this line at the bottom, saves a lot of menace with the ros2 sourcing.
source /home/dev/RaspberryCore/CoreRaspberry/install/local_setup.bash

And this line to set the ros domain ID

export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=32
echo -e "ROS_DOMAIN_ID: \033[32m$ROS_DOMAIN_ID\033[0m"
